Welcome to the **Decision Trees for Classification** course repository! This course is designed to help you learn how to build, visualize, and optimize decision trees for classification tasks using Python. Whether you're new to machine learning or want to sharpen your skills, this course will provide you with the hands-on experience needed to master decision trees.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll learn:
- What a decision tree is and how it works.
- When to use decision trees and when they might not be the best choice.
- How to preprocess data for decision tree models.
- Building decision trees using popular Python libraries like `scikit-learn`.
- Techniques for pruning decision trees to prevent overfitting.
- Visualizing and interpreting decision tree outputs.
